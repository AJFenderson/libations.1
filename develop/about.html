      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <h3>
        Who doesn't like a good bar-hop night with friends? Though our founders
        know their local hot spots, whenever they traveled outside of their
        city, they had a hard time finding that place that only locals know is
        special. The problem was that, by the time they find a local whose
        enthusiasm for a good time matched theirs, the reliability of
        information would diminish as the night waned. Founded in 2020 by
        Annaruth McBride and Cha Alexander, Libations was created to solve that
        specific problem.
